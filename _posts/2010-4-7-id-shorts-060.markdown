The Id Shorts plugin for Movable Type provides a cgi script that, when passed an entry id, will return a redirect to the permalink of that entry.  With a little mod_rewrite magic, you could use it to build custom short urls for your site.  For example <http://rayners.org/6> will bring you back to this entry.  It can also optionally track click-throughs and display the number in the edit entry page.

Information on installation and setup is in the [README][1] in the github repository for the plugin: <http://github.com/rayners/mt-plugin-id-shorts>
