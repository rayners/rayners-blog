I have always loved the stars and the night sky.  For a number of years recently, I forgot how much I enjoyed them, but I am bringing them back into my life.  One of the first habits I want to form is to start regularly stargazing.

* **Specifics:**

    At least twice a week, spend five or more minutes looking up at the night sky.  Locate either the Big Dipper or Orion each time.
* **Relevant Goals:**
    * "[Be Happy][happy]":

        Looking at the night sky relaxes me greatly and never fails to bring a smile to my face.
    * "[Be Healthy][healthy]":

        Stargazing gets me out of my head for a little while, helps to keep me grounded and gives me some much needed perspective.  It is hard to worry about most of the problems of life when you are trying to comprehend the vastness of the universe.
* **Possibile Future Habits:**
    * Increased time and frequency
    * Learning and locating additional constellations
* **Possible Future Goals:**
    * See the Milky Way
* **Revisit:**

    I will revisit this habit in two weeks, including a progress report and any plans for modification or expansion.
