Whenever something gets me thinking about my age (you know, like today being my 32nd birthday), I always come back to this XKCD:

[![Lease](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lease.png "You should talk to the girl down the hall; I think you'd like her.  Lemme know if you find out why she's ordering all those colored plastic balls.")](http://xkcd.com/616/)
