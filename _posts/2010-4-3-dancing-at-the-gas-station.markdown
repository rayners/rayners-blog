The boys are spending the night at their grandmother's tonight.  They were told that they would be going up to her house at around 4pm, and they spent all day either asking me if or telling me that it was 4pm, and I'm pretty sure Nick spent most of the day with his backpack ("packpack!") on.

On the way up there, I had to stop for gas and William asked if he could help; Nick has helped pump gas a couple times before, but William had never expressed interest.  So I had him help me get the gas tank open and select the grade, then we danced to the music being piped over the gas station's speakers while we waited for the tank to fill.

I love to watch them dance and to see how easy it is for them to just *be* joyful.
