So I feel like I should write up an about me page or at least include some contact information for me somewhere, considering I suggested that people let me know if there are any plugins they would like to see on github sooner rather than later.

I'm also (again) thinking about some kind of "Ask Rayners" section.  I imagine it would mostly be Movable Type based, but I'm open to other things.

So is there anything anybody would like me to include in my about page?  Anybody feel like writing a short bio of me?
