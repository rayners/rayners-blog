One of my absolutely favorite discoveries since I started giving Emacs another try has been the wonderful [Org-mode](http://orgmode.org).  It is an outlining mode on mega-steroids.

My first thought was that a fancy outlining mode was nice, but I did not expect to find any use for it.  Man, was I wrong!  I now use it to manage my todo and project lists, track my time and calendar, write estimates and generally just organize my brain.  Just ask anybody I work with; I praise Org-mode *constantly*.

The author gave a talk at Google a couple years ago and you can see it on youtube.  It is well worth the 45 minutes.

Even if I stop using Emacs as my primary text editor, I have a feeling I will continue using it just for Org-mode alone.
