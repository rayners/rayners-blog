In a recent driving-home conversation I had with the boys, I went on to discuss some of the basics of capitalism and how money works.  Here's a rough transcript:

> Me: [explaining why we pay their preschool and what they do with the money]
> 
> William: Why?
> 
> Me: Because that's how capitalism works.
> 
> William: I don't like that.

This might, at least partially, explain his preference for pink.
