Maybe it is silly to have "Be Happy" as a goal, but I think it is a pretty important thing to strive for.  I could probably lump this goal in with the mental and spiritual portions of the "Be Healthy" goal, but I think "Be Happy" is slightly different.  In my mind, mental and spiritual health are one thing and actively seeking joy is, while related, something else entirely.  And that is why it gets its own goal on my list.
