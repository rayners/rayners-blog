I went out to look at the stars tonight.  I was going outside to get some groceries out of the back of my car, and I decided to lean back against the car and look up for a little while first.

The Big Dipper was easy to spot, as it has been lately.  I did not see Orion tonight, but I think this is not the time of year to be seeing it.  I need to learn more about the constellations.

The longer I stayed out and looked up, the more adjusted my eyes got to the dark (as much as that is possible with the street lamps nearby) and the more stars I started to see.  It was wonderful.
