Values and principles are, in my mind, things to keep in mind while I build my goals, evaluate my progress with the metrics, and create new habits with which to move forward.

* Progress, not perfection.

    Perfectionism is something I fight with often, and not being able to finish something completely and perfectly can be enough to keep me from starting in the first place.  The journey of one thousand miles may start with a single step, but that single step does not have to be one thousand miles long.

* This too shall pass.

    Life is not always perfect; it can be really rough sometimes.  Instead of reacting to problems and setbacks out of anger, fear or desperation, I should take a moment, let those emotions run their course and regain my rational self before reacting to the situation.

* Forgive, but not excuse.

    Noticing a trend?  I know I need to be able to give myself a break, *but* I cannot allow myself to just make up excuses either.
