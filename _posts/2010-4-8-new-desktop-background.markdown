[Matt Jacobs][capn] pointed me at [this iPad wallpaper][wallp] tonight, and given that the boys are constantly trying to touch my laptop's screen (because, as far as they know, everything *is* touch sensitive), I thought I might honor them with usage of that wallpaper on my laptop.  So I downloaded the image, rotated it in Preview and set it as my background.  Behold!
