I need to take control (and responsibility!) of my diet.  I don't think I'm prepared to go full-on vegan, especially with the boys and their dietary requirements around.  But I can make better choices about the meat that I do choose to prepare and eat.

* **Specifics:**

    Eat red meat (beef, duck, pepperoni, salami, and so forth) no more than twice a week.  I'm tempted to include bacon on the list, even considering that it's pork.  Because it's bacon.

* **Relevant Goals:**
    * "[Be Healthy][healthy]":

        I want to eat better.

* **Possible Future Habits:**
    * Eat even less red meat
    * Eat more fruits and vegatables

* **Possible Future Goals:**
    * Specific weight loss

* **Revisit:**

    I will revisit this habit in one month.
