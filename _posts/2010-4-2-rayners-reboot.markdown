So I'm rebooting rayners.org, if you haven't already noticed.  I need to write more and think less, and there was a lot of baggage on the old site.

The old site is now completely offline.  The files are all backed up and I will eventually be moving plugins that are still relevant to github; if there are any you would prefer to see available again sooner rather than later, please let me know.
