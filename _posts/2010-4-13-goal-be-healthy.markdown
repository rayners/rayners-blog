First and foremost among my goals is "Be Healthy".  And I do not just mean physical health, but also mental and spiritual health.  Being in ridiculously good shape does me no good if I am unhappy (though I suppose it would still help).

# Metrics

How can I track progress?  Well, for the physical portion of the goal, it is simple:

* Weight
* Heart rate
* Endurance
* Cholesterol
* ...

Lots of options there.

For the mental and spiritual parts of the goal, I am going to have to fudge the measurability requirement I have for my goals a little and just gauge how I am feeling.  They are there to keep in mind while I am building new habits, to keep me from focusing solely on my physical health, because I am a whole being with many facets and such.
