I'm in the process of building a list of goals that I want to work towards this year.  Applying my programmer-brain to the process, I have a list of goal criteria that I'm working with.

* The wording of the goal has to use an active verb.

    The goal has to be something I am actively engaged in.

* The goal has to be measurable in some way.

    The goal itself doesn't have to have a specific metric, but I should be able to create one or more metrics with the goal as a starting point.  If I can't measure my progress somehow, the goal is not very useful or productive.

* The goal has to be self-centered.

    That may sound very selfish, but I consider it more pragmatic than anything.  Keeping in mind the first criteria, the goal has to involve _me_ doing something.  And to keep myself sane, the goal has to be something I am entirely in control of, which limits it to only my own actions or reactions to the world around me.

I've got a couple in mind that I'll be writing about soon.  And I may add more later in the year.  There is no better time than "now" to add a new life goal.  I also plan to start implementing (and writing about!) new habits as well; habits specifically derived from one or more goals and the metrics I set out for them.  I figure I'll be adding a new habit every few weeks or so, depending on how well each habit takes hold.
