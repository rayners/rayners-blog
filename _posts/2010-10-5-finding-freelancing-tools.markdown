I am taking on some freelance work in the short term while I figure out what I am going to be doing in the long run.  But if my last attempt at doing that has taught me anything, it is that I am horrible at managing the non-technical parts of the thing.

I figure I am going to need to cover the following steps somehow:

* Finding clients/projects
* Estimating
* Time Tracking
* Invoicing/Billing

So far, I have pulled together the following list of tools that I am already using or want to try out:

* [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with [Org-Mode](http://orgmode.org) (this is the one I am already using)
* [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/)
* [Billings](http://www.marketcircle.com/billings/)
* [Blinksale](http://blinksale.com/)
* [Freshbooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/)
* [MyClientBase](http://www.myclientbase.com/)
* [QuickBooks Online](http://quickbooksonline.intuit.com/)

I would start with the first step (Finding clients/projects), but I honestly do not know where to even start with that.  Is this where "CRM" tools come into play?  My understanding of that space is vague at best.  As it stands now, I am just using my network of contacts to find work over email, instant messenger and phone calls.

I am open to other tool suggestions, and would be happy to hear how I might benefit from a CRM tool of some kind.
