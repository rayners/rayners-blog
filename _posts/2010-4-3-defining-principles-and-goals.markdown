I want to be blogging more about my personal goals, how I picked them and how I am working to achieve them.  To start with, I wanted to talk about my overall goals for the year.

Start with a core principle:

# I can only control my own actions and reactions.

Concepts:

* Active verbs
* Self-centered
* Measurable

Goals:

# Be healthier

# Be a good father

#
