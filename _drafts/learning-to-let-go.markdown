One of the hardest things for me to do is give up control. I think that is why I write software for a living. And probably also why I am such a fan of automation. Predictability is control.

Kids are not predictable. One four year old is tough enough at times, but two are a force of nature. By stepping back and not trying to control them, I got to spend a weekend with my boys building blanket forts.
