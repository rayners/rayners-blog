I am not good at email.

* Unsubscribe from many of the technical mailing lists that I am on and don't pay any attention to
   * Read them on gmane with gnus
* Use wanderlust and offlineimap to read my emails locally
   * Fancy and speedy local search software
   * Doing it in emacs allows me to:
     * Use the keyboard controls that I am used to for text editing
     * Integration with org-mode
     * Generally increase potential for automation
